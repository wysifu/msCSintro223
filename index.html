        <h3>what is computer programming</h3>

        <p>
            computer programming, also known as coding is the process of using a programming language to give a set of instructions
            to a computer so it can perform a task. This is done in a step by step process.

        <h3>why learn to program ?</h3>

        <p>
            computers are integrated in some form or fashion with almost everything in the world today,
            and it has been this way for some time now. computers and technology in general 
            has helped society, and in many ways, made our life much easier.

        <p>
            we all know how to use these devices, but not many of us know how all of these devices work
            under the hood. 
        </p>

        <aside>
            <strong>imagine</strong> driving from jacksonville, florida to omaha, nebraska in 1976 ? would 
            it be easier if i gave you a device with a global positioning system capabilities ?

            <li><h4>personal development</h4></li>

            <p>
                computer programming can initiate or ignite the development of creative and cognitive skills, improve 
                memory, and increase problem solving skills. the problem solving skills attained from learning to program
                are integratable to all other aspects of life. coding also gives ample opportunities to practice or showcase
                one's math, writing, and science skills. 
                <br>
                <br>
                most of all computer programming will instill habits of critical thinking, perserverance, interpretation skills
                and independence.

            <li><h4>lifestyle</h4></li>

            <p>
                the lifestyle of people who work with computers and computer programming is a vast space
                with completely different instances far and between. 
                <br>

                - some software engineers have the ability to work remotely,
                <br>
                - some have the opportunity to experience ultra modern buildings with healthy working environments that boost 
                productivity. 
                <br>
                - some hardware engineers work in their oversized garage behind their house..
                <br>
                - some work in mega large space grade\ facilities.
